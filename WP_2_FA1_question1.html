    <p><strong><em>The history of the automobile</em></strong> begins as early as <i>1769</i>, with the creation of steam engined automobiles capable of human transport.
   In 1806, the first cars powered by aninternal combustion engine running on fuel gas appeared, 
   which led to the introduction in <i>1885</i> of the ubiquitous modern gasoline- or petrol-fueled internal combustion engine..<br><br>

   The year <i>1886</i> is regarded the year of birth of the modern automobile - with the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, by German inventor Carl Benz.<br><br>

  Cars powered by electric power briefly appeared at the turn of the 20th century but largely disappeared from use until the turn of the 21st century.
  The early history of the automobile can be divided into a number of eras, based on the prevalent means of propulsion. 
  Later periods were defined by trends in exterior styling, size, and utility preferences.<br><br>

  Ferdinand Verbiest, a member of a Jesuit mission in China, built the first steam-powered vehicle around <i>1672</i> as a toy for the Chinese Emperor. 
  It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly, the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').<br><br>

  Among other efforts, in <i>1815</i>, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car. 
  Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in <i>1838</i> built a four-seat steam phaeton.<br><br>

  In <i>1828</i>, Ányos Jedlik, a Hungarian who invented an early type of electric motor, created a tiny model car powered by his new motor.
  In <i>1834</i>, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport, the inventor of the first American DC electrical motor, installed his motor in a small model car, 
  which he operated on a short circular electrified track. In <i>1835</i>, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh ofGroningen,
   the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker created a small-scale electrical car, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells
    In <i>1838</i>, Scotsman Robert Davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of 4 miles per hour (6 km/h). In England, 
    a patent was granted in <i>1840</i> for the use of rail tracks as conductors of electric current, 
    and similar American patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in <i>1847</i>. Between <i>1832</i> and <i>1839</i> (the exact year is uncertain), 
    Robert Anderson of Scotland invented the first crude electric carriage, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells.<br><br>

  Early attempts at making and using internal combustion engines were hampered by the lack of suitable fuels, particularly liquids, 
  therefore the earliest engines used gas mixtures.<br><br>

  Early experimenters used gases. In <i>1806</i>, Swiss engineer François Isaac de Rivaz who built an engine powered by internal combustion of a
  hydrogen and oxygen mixture. In 1826, EnglishmanSamuel Brown who tested his hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engine by using it to propel a
   vehicle up Shooter's Hill in south-east London. 
   Belgian-born Etienne Lenoir's Hippomobile with a hydrogen-gas-fuelled one-cylinder internal combustion 
   engine made a test drive from Paris to Joinville-le-Pont in <i>1860</i>, covering some nine kilometres in about three hours. A later version was propelled by coal gas.
    A Delamare-Deboutteville vehicle was patented and trialled in <i>1884</i>.<br><br>
